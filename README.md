# Dwahfy Community Web UI

The official open-source web client for the [Dwahfy](https://github.com/Dwahfy) platform — built for self-hosters, contributors, and the community.

This is **not** the official Dwahfy app UI (which is closed-source). This is the community edition — a collaborative, open project that anyone can contribute to, improve, and build upon.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) — React framework
- [React](https://react.dev/) — UI library
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) — Type safety
- [Axios](https://axios-http.com/) — HTTP client for connecting to the Dwahfy backend

---

## 📦 Current State

The UI is **somewhat functional** — core structure is in place and it connects to the Dwahfy backend. There is a lot of room to grow, and that's exactly where contributors come in.

## 🤝 Contributing

Contributions of all kinds are welcome! Here's what we especially need help with:

### 🎨 UI/UX Design *(most wanted)*

- Improving existing page layouts and components
- Creating a consistent visual style and design language
- Mobile-friendly / responsive design improvements
- Accessibility improvements

### 🔗 Frontend ↔ Backend Integration
Help wire up the frontend to the [Dwahfy-Core](https://github.com/Dwahfy/Dwahfy-Core) backend API.

- Connecting UI components to API endpoints
- Testing API responses and handling edge cases
- Improving error handling and loading states

### 🧹 General Frontend Development
- Bug fixes and code cleanup
- Performance improvements
- Adding missing features (feeds, profiles, posts, etc.)
